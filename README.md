# MiniGames
Repository of small mini-games coded within java

'Finished' Works:

Jumpy Ball: Flappy bird clone, moves with spacebar, avoid the moving walls.

Mario Game: Jump around as Mario and collect all the coins, avoid the Bullet Bill and Thwomp!


Works in Progress:

Clingy Wall: Jump up a vertical scrolling map and cling to the walls.
  ~game needs a bunch of polish, no way to win or keep score, no real aim to the game yet
 
Chess: Classic chess game. Play local against another player.
  ~game needs finishing touches, track winning circumstances (display check and checkmate), quit, confirm piece movements valid
